# machine-learning-challenge
Can we determine planet habitability? Can we train computers to determine habitability for us? This project uses machine learning tools found on SciKit Learn to find habitability patterns in Kepler planetary data. The most successful models include a deep learning neural network algorithm, a decision tree, and random forest with hyperparameters maximized by GridSearchCV. Inside the each model's jupyter notebook you'll find code that runs upwards of a dozen categories through a machine learning model that prints an accuracy. Afterwhich you can save the model. Models ExoplanetDecisionTree.sav, ExoplanetRandomForest.sav, exoplanetNeuralNetwork.h5 and exoplanetNeuralNetworkDeep.h5 are downloadable models.
