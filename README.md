# machine-learning-challenge
In this project I use machine learning tools found on SciKit Learn to find habitability patterns in Kepler planetary data. The most successful models include a deep learning neural network algorithm and a decision tree and random forest with hyperparameters maximized by GridSearchCV.

Special thanks to Aleksey Bilogur (https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario) for scraping the data and making this project possible.
